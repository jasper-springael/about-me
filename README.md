# Jasper's About me.

## What's it about?

One of the project's contains some of my basic info's. Some killer song lyrics are also found where I didn't have any content yet.
On another page you'll find my coding experience in a nice and centralized format. My experience is quite expansive, as shown, so again... loads of content.
On the last page you'll find a working contact form (errmagerd).

## What did I use?
- Lobster font of course, is there another????
- Years and years of no css experience.
- Many, many salty tears.

**For the realzies now.**

## What did I learn.

1. HTML feels a bit easier but it's extremely important to get it right. Correcting a bad structure is time consuming.
2. Don't get hung up on styling details.
3. Understanding some basic principles in CSS. Some of the more complicated stuff are very much still read and type but this will get better the more I use them.
4. Simply copying stuff doesn't teach you anything and the moment you wanna put your own twist to it without understanding it, everything goes to shit. Don't do it except when it's just formulaic stuff like a reset.
5. When styling, don't try to style everything like it's seperate. Try to styling method and apply it consistently throughout your project.

***6. Use waayyyyyyyy more comments in your code. It gives you structure, it gives you sanity.***
***7. Divide up your project and do 1 THING AT A TIME. Jumping from thing to thing gets messy REAL fast, just take your time to perfect one aspect, add/commit/push and on to the next thing. Don't make your form, change a font on another page and make some new classes for a paragraph all at the same time. Focus.***

## Message to myself
Don't try to skip ahead, dive into the basics. The rest will come with practice.
