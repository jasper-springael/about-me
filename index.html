                    <p class= "p1">     If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
                            If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
                            When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
                            Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
                            Lord mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
                            It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
                            Oh well, oh well, oh well
                            Don't it make you feel bad
                            When you're tryin' to find your way home
                            You don't know which way to go?
                            If you're goin' down South
                            They got no work to do
                            If you don't know about Chicago
                            Cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
                            Now cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
                            When the levee breaks mama you got to move
                            All last night sat on the levee and moaned
                            All last night sat on the levee and moaned
                            Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home
                            Going to Chicago
                            Going to Chicago
                            Sorry but I can't take you
                            Going down, going down now, going down
                            Going down now, going down
                            Going down, going down, going down
                            Going down now, going down
                            Going down now, going down
                            Going down now, going down
                            Going d-d-d-d-down
                            Woo, woo</p></br>    
                        <h3> Song 2</h3>
                        <p class="p2">
                        Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
                        Stars fill my dream
                        I'm a traveler of both time and space
                        To be where I have been
                        Sit with elders of the gentle race
                        This world has seldom seen
                        They talk of days for which they sit and wait
                        All will be revealed
                        Talk in song in tongues of lilting grace
                        Sounds caress my ear
                        There are not a word I heard could I relate
                        Story was quite clear
                        Oh
                        Oh
                        Oh yeah I been flyin'
                        Love oh ain't no denyin', no
                        Oh, ooh yea, I been flyin'
                        Mama, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin'
                        All I see turns to brown
                        As the sun burns the ground
                        And my eyes fill with sand
                        As I scan this wasted land
                        Try to find, try to find what I feel
                        Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
                        Like thoughts inside a dream
                        Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
                        My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again
                        Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir
                        Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years
                        With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear
                        Oh
                        Oh
                        When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
                        When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
                        Tryin' to find, tryin' to find where I been yeah, yeah
                        Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
                        Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down
                        Ooh, let me take you there
