                            If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
                            When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay
                            Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
                            Lord mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
                            It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
                            Oh well, oh well, oh well
                            Don't it make you feel bad
                            When you're tryin' to find your way home
                            You don't know which way to go?
                            If you're goin' down South
                            They got no work to do
                            If you don't know about Chicago
                            Cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
                            Now cryin' won't help you prayin' won't do you no good
                            When the levee breaks mama you got to move
                            All last night sat on the levee and moaned
                            All last night sat on the levee and moaned
                            Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home
                            Going to Chicago
                            Going to Chicago
